00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
 At the weekend I realised I'd left my favourite jumper in the boot of the car,

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,840
 so I popped down from my flat, joined the queue by the kerb outside,

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,640
 and waited while a lorry delivered petrol to the station opposite the shopping centre.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,040
 On holiday I'd promised my neighbour I'd organise a programme of activities for the children,

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,320
 including swimming at the local leisure centre, football on the pitch by the metre-high fence,

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,780
 and a visit to the theatre in the city centre.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,760
 Before travelling I wrote a cheque to pay for the jewellery repair,

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,720
 checked the timetable for the trains,

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,780
 and practised my presentation for the defence of our proposal at the council.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,980
 At half four I bought a packet of crisps and a biscuit from the shop,

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,460
 threw the rubbish in the bin,

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,340
 and headed home to tidy the garden before the autumn weather got worse.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,060
 Later I booked a table in a cosy restaurant,

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,820
 made sure the licence for the car was up to date,

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,780
 and told my mum I'd ring her from the motorway service station on the way back from the hospital.
