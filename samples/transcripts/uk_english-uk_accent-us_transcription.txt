 At the weekend I realized I'd left my favorite jumper in the boot of the car,
 so I popped down from my flat, joined the queue by the kerb outside,
 and waited while a lorry delivered petrol to the station opposite the shopping center.
 On holiday I'd promised my neighbor I'd organize a program of activities for the children,
 including swimming at the local leisure center, football on the pitch by the metre-high fence,
 and a visit to the theater in the city center.
 Before traveling I wrote a check to pay for the jewelry repair,
 checked the timetable for the trains,
 and practised my presentation for the defense of our proposal at the council.
 At half four I bought a packet of crisps and a biscuit from the shop,
 threw the rubbish in the bin,
 and headed home to tidy the garden before the autumn weather got worse.
 Later I booked a table in a cozy restaurant,
 made sure the licence for the car was up to date,
 and told my mum I'd ring her from the motorway service station on the way back from the hospital.
