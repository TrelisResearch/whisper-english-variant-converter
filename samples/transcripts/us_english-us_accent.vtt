00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
 On the weekend, I realized I'd left my favorite sweater in the trunk of the car,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.980
 so I came down from my apartment, stood in line by the curb outside,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.700
 and waited while a truck delivered gas to the station across from the shopping center.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.360
 On vacation, I promised my neighbor I'd organize a program of activities for the kids,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.240
 including swimming at the local recreation center,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.040
 soccer on the field by the meter-high fence,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.840
 and a trip to the theater in the downtown area.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.020
 Before traveling, I wrote a check to pay for the jewelry repair,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.200
 checked the schedule for the trains,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.500
 and practiced my presentation for the defense of our proposal at City Council.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.780
 At 4.30, I bought a bag of chips and a cookie from the store,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.940
 threw the trash in the garbage can,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.280
 and headed home to clean up the yard before the fall weather got worse.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.480
 Later, I reserved a table at a cozy restaurant,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.840
 made sure the license for the car was current,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.180
 and told my mom I'd call her from the highway rest stop on the way back from the hospital.
