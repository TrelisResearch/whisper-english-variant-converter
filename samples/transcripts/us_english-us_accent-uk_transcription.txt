 On the weekend, I realised I'd left my favourite sweater in the trunk of the car,
 so I came down from my apartment, stood in line by the kerb outside,
 and waited while a truck delivered gas to the station across from the shopping centre.
 On vacation, I promised my neighbour I'd organise a programme of activities for the kids,
 including swimming at the local recreation centre,
 soccer on the field by the metre-high fence,
 and a trip to the theatre in the downtown area.
 Before travelling, I wrote a cheque to pay for the jewellery repair,
 chequed the schedule for the trains,
 and practised my presentation for the defence of our proposal at City Council.
 At 4.30, I bought a bag of chips and a cookie from the store,
 threw the trash in the garbage can,
 and headed home to clean up the yard before the fall weather got worse.
 Later, I reserved a table at a cosy restaurant,
 made sure the licence for the car was current,
 and told my mom I'd call her from the highway rest stop on the way back from the hospital.
